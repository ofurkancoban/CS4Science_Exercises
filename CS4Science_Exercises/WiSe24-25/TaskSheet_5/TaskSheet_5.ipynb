    "\n",
    "### Steps to Do:\n",
    "1. **Let the user enter the name of the text file to be formatted.**\n",
    "   - If no filename is entered, the text file **\"Lorem ipsum.txt\"** should be used.\n",
    "   - Make sure that the file to be read ends with **\".txt\"**.\n",

    "2. **Ask the user which pattern they want to use and read the pattern file.**\n",
    "   - Feel free to define files with your own patterns and add them to the list of choices.\n",
    "   - *(The font in your editor should be set to a \"monospaced\" font. In monospaced fonts, each symbol has the same width.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check each symbol in the pattern:**\n",
    "   - Let **marker** be the symbol used in the pattern (e.g., `marker == \"x\"`).\n",
    "   - For each symbol in the pattern:\n",
    "     - **If the current symbol is not the marker:**\n",
    "       - Append the symbol to the output text.\n",
    "     - **Otherwise:**\n",
    "       - Append the next symbol of the given text to the output text, but skip newlines.\n",
    "       - If the given text is shorter than the pattern, continue at the beginning of the text (see Example 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Print the output and write it to a file.**\n",
    "   - The name of the output file should be built by:\n",
    "     - The name of the original (given) text.\n",
    "     - The name of the pattern that was used.\n",
    "     - The extension **\".txt\"**."
